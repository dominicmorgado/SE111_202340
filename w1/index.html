        <p> Hi! My name is Dominic Morgado. I am 29 years old and will be turning 30 in September, which I didn't expect to come so fast. A couple interests in my life are video games, sports, traveling/photography. Video games will always be big to me. Of course because I enjoy playing with friends, the various games and being a competitive person. But, also because it gives me a huge sense of relaxtion. I could be having a terrible day and once I start playing my problems go away and I am in a better mood. Another way of relieving stress is sports, especially playing whatever sport between basketball, football or soccer. Watching sports is something I've always done with family and friends. Being around your favorite people watching the games is one of my favorite things to do. I am a big foodie and love the different scenaries different countries/cultures have to offer. That's why I enjoy traveling and photography. I am not a person that takes the photos but someone who enjoys photos others take. </p>

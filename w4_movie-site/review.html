            <h2><b>Review |</b> <em>Extraction II</em></h2>
            
            <p><b> Dominic Morgado</b> <i>August 10, 2023</i></p>
            <p><em>Extraction II</em> continues along from the first one with all the extra packed shooting and fight scenes. It picks up from the results of the ending of the first movie with Tyler (Chris Hemsworth) recovering/retiring. He is then approached by Alcott with a mission he cannot turn away due to guilt and things that has happened in his past. There are two recurring characters from the first part that join the mission along with Tyler. Not only do you get to witness the quick backstory of the “good guys” you get the same for the bad guys. From the start of their childhood and the events of their upbringing and you can see why they are who the are and what they do. It's a product of their environment in a sense which people can relate to.</p>
                                 
            <p>All the fighting/shooting scenes keep you very entertained and, on your heels, wondering what's going to happen next. Golshifteh Farahani, Adam Bessa, and Tornike Gogrichiani are a stellar cast alongside Chris Hemsworth and they all compliment one another perfectly. You sometimes can tell what will happen next in certain scenes but regardless of that it is a very solid action movie and a good follow up sequel. I am excited to see what is in store for the future of this franchise. If you enjoyed the <em>Extracion</em> you will enjoy this one just as much.</p>
